# Wagtail Templates

This directory contains a range of Wagtail project templates, edited to implement the Cinderblock components.  The user should request a new template through the cli comment `start --template`.

By default Cinderblock provides the latest copy of a wagtail (edited) site. for new projects. Review the `start` command for implementation.
