# Development Method

> What _type_ of web development is supported! I bet it's not mine...

**Cinderblock supports any ui development method** from SPA to classical. We cater to all forms of web development - allowing you use to use React, or Angular, Or _the raw method_.

## Classical Monoliths

Build good-old-fashioned _"Create Read Update Delete"_ views through standard endpoint modelling and serving then from a single service. Perfect for building super-sized applications with integrity and security in-mind.

## SPA

**SPA out the box!** With tools to help you deploy your templates, assets, and resources without rewriting the cinderblock core solution. Under the hood you can serve "a view" and write any data endpoints to support your page.

## SAAS and Micro-service

**Sevices as a service tooling out of the box!** With cinderblock endpoints and JSON responses, build well-behaved sturdy data-endpoints for pure micro-service integration.

## CMS

**Content Management our of the box!** Focus on providing your frontend solution, utilising the built-in administation features for highly configurable editing features. Build your own full wordpress solution, seemlessly integrating with all Cinderblock features.


### Cinderblocks Blocks Blocks!

Cinderblock is build on Django core, Wagtail for the admin features, and a bunch of other evergreen open-source products. We build `cinderblock` blocks on top of all this to give you **Plug and play integration** for blocks.

Use blocks to extend the model base, to provide your client with highly dynamic tooling:

+ Work with "model" serving `blocks`
+ Build business logic, serving as plug-and-play components for your production
+ Serve "block" information as JSON for an instant API.
+ Use the blocks with `SPA`, `CMS`, classical modelling and more.

Developers rejoice!!! Blocks are built with the a _"developer first"_ mentality:

+ Build components through the same low-code API
+ Free instant production-ready UI for blocks (thanks to Wagtail)
+ Feature switching for composed deployments
+ modularity in mind, with a focus on multi project tooling built-in.


## Headless!

**We offer a fully headless solution out the box!** Utilising the data-modelling design and using the amazing _"blocks"_ on the page model to serve JSON from your CMS controller.


# Why

Cinderblock is built upon the (seriously senior now) mature web-development solution _Django_, and packages some of the best products to serve you production ready components out the box.

> Our goal is to offer a solution for you - to develop your app. Not for us to serve you _our product_ for _our_ merit.

In the company we already have:

+ \*more than 6 "official" front-ends
+ \*more than 3 design docs
+ Many "developer" solution
+ More than X "low code" and design platforms
+ Deployment solutions
+ Database solutions
+ Integrated single sign on and authentications

**Another "full-stack" solution is not required**. Cinderblock offers a business compliant python-backend. Designed to serve content in a non-opinionated manner.

> We provide a backend builders and engineers. We **want** a developer to forget about the Cinderblocks holding up the building, and focus on the work within.

When your boss asks _"What tool did we use to build this app?"_ The answer is "Django, Wagtail, and Cinderblock."

---

> Our opinion? no opinion.

Cinderblock is a "no opinion" solution. This may also be known as "renderless views", "vendorless", or "White-label" - But it all means one thing. We don't have an opinon on _your method to write a web-app_.

We agree that many web-development solutions are correct, and the archiecture within should support developer choice. Indeed the choice may be "what the company prefers". But that's non of our business... We offer you a white-label, no-branded, no front-end, no enforcements, backend.

> A focus on the developer

We provide tooling with the end-developer (the literal source code writer) as our first consideration. Cinderblock API offers _backend_ tooling for developers to easily integrate, and a comprehensive "view" solution fit for production.

We offer blocks; built to ensure the developer can write expressive templates (html), models (database), and logic (views) with easy clear management. All modeling works with the migrations, all views work with all deployment methods; no compromises.

> B.Y.O.F

Doesn't it suck when you find a great solution, only to find it's stuck on aging creaky JS libraries? **Cinderblock promotes "Bring your own front-end"**, allowing you to pick the _"flavour"_ for your organisation without jumping through cinderblock hoops.

Don't have a frontend? Don't use one! Cinderblock can run completely headless without any exposed UI - purly data or endpoint form.

Don't know frontend? No problem. Cinderblock offers free CSS and JS tooling to help build first apps such as `django-trim` and `polyclass.js`.
