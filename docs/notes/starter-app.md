# Start App

Portland should offer a "quick start" for fresh developers, of which provides a small terminal input system offseting complex tasks, such as creating an environment.

It's designed to be accessible therefore the name should be easy and helpful. Some initial ideas:

1. `$> portland blueprint`
    Potentially a good name for pulling future 'blueprints' not specifically _new projects_.
2. `$> portland foundation`
3. `$> portland scaffold`
    Another favourite, but offers more than _new projects_ and could be used in the future.
5. `$> portland mortar`
    Potentially evokes the wrong concepts
6. `$> portland forge`
7. `$> portland cast`
    My Favourite
